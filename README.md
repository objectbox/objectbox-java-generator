# ObjectBox Gradle Plugin
                            
The ObjectBox Gradle Plugin makes using ObjectBox easy in a JVM or Android project written in Java or Kotlin, 
and is free and open source. See the [documentation on how to get started](https://docs.objectbox.io/getting-started).

The plugin

- automatically adds a dependency on [the Java SDK](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-java) and if needed the
  [Kotlin extension functions](https://docs.objectbox.io/kotlin-support) library,
- automatically adds runtime libraries for Android and the developer machine,
- adds and configures the annotation processor to generate the model JSON file and source code like the `MyObjectBox`
  and underscore classes (like `Example_`) used for [queries](https://docs.objectbox.io/queries),
- for Android and Java JVM projects, registers a byte code transformer to 
  [make relations easier to use](https://docs.objectbox.io/relations#initialization-magic)

## Minimum requirements to apply the plugin

- Gradle `7.0` (see [GradleCompat](objectbox-gradle-plugin/src/main/kotlin/io/objectbox/gradle/util/GradleCompat.kt))
- Android Plugin `4.1` (see [AndroidCompat](objectbox-gradle-plugin/src/main/kotlin/io/objectbox/gradle/util/AndroidCompat.kt))
- JDK 8

## Development

This project is known to build with JDK 17.

This repository contains a collection of Gradle subprojects:
- `objectbox-gradle-plugin` provides the actual Gradle plugins (`io.objectbox` and `io.objectbox.sync`),
- `objectbox-processor` provides an annotation processor,
- `objectbox-generator` provides a source code generator used by the annotation processor,
- `objectbox-code-modifier` provides model file ("IdSync") generation used by the annotation processor,
  and byte-code transformers for Android and Java projects.
  - Multiple `agp-wrapper-x-y` projects provide a compatibility layer for specific versions
    of the Android Plugin API, currently for byte-code transforms only.

All are published as Maven artifacts (see `gradle` folder).
                                                
### Adding a new property type

This is a checklist on how to add support for a new property type:

-  (Optional) Java: update generated Flatbuffers Java classes to add new `PropertyType`.
-  Generator: add new generator `PropertyType` and map it to the Java API `PropertyType`.
-  Processor: add a field with each new supported type to `SimpleEntity.java` (`SimpleEntityTest`).
-  Processor: update to detect the new property types (also check if indexes should be prevented).
  - Update the model expected by the test.
-  Java API: add new collect methods to `Cursor.java`.
-  Generator: update `PropertyCollector` to generate code using the new collect methods.
  - Update the generated files expected by the test.
- Java integration tests: add a field with the new type to `TestEntity.java`, update `BoxTest.java`.
  - Java: update `TestEntity` and tests with code (incl. generated by the plugin) of integration tests.
- Java: add additional tests as needed, e.g. query the new property.
